<h4><strong>Auto-healer using Zookeeper</strong></h4><p><br></p><p>In cloud computing, auto-healing is a feature used to monitor a cluster and detect faulty application instances.</p><p>If a faulty instance is detected, the node is shut down and a new node is created with a healthy application instance.</p><p>In this practical assignment we will implement a very basic auto healer which will monitor a group of worker instances.</p><p><br></p><p>You are given a worker application</p><p>The worker instances are running a very complex computation that tends to crash in a particular edge case that the author did not account for.</p><p>Our mission is to maintain at least <strong>N worker</strong> nodes at any given moment.</p><p>If a worker crashes, we need to start a new worker.</p><p><br></p><h4>Instructions</h4><p>Please download the attached resources. </p><p>(The solution is also provided, please try your best before looking at the solution)</p><p>In the downloaded resources you will find </p><ol><li><p>The <strong>flaky worker</strong>. This is a program that emulates a worker that randomly dies due to an exception</p></li><li><p>The <strong>Auto-healer.&nbsp;</strong>This is only a partially complete project, your task is to complete the unimplemented methods</p></li></ol><p>Once the implementation is complete. </p><ol><li><p>Run Zookeeper by running the zkServer.XX start command in the <strong>bin</strong> directory</p></li><li><p>Build the worker project using the&nbsp; <code>mvn clean install</code> command</p></li><li><p>Following the Autohealer README for building and running the autohealer to launch and maintain any number of workers</p></li></ol><p>Please follow the <em>"Zookeeper Server and Client (Download and Setup)"</em> lecture for instructions on how to download, install and configure Zookeeper.</p><p>Good luck!:)</p>
